# Customer Churn Prediction with XGBoost

## Description
This project predicts customer churn for a telecommunications company using historical data. The model identifies customers at high risk of leaving, providing insights to guide retention strategies.

## Key Features
- **End-to-end Pipeline:** Covers data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training.
- **Optimized Model:** Uses an XGBoost classifier tuned to handle class imbalance and achieve high accuracy.
- **Actionable Insights:** The final model provides a clear understanding of churn drivers.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **XGBoost**

## How to Run
The project is a self-contained Google Colab notebook (`ChurnPredictionAnalysis.ipynb`). It loads data from a URL and can be run from top to bottom without any local setup.

## Result
The final, optimized model achieved a **ROC AUC Score of over 0.90** on the test set, demonstrating strong predictive power.
